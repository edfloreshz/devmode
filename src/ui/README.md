# COSMIC Application Template

A template for COSMIC applications.

## Getting Started

To get started, click the "Use this template" button above. This will create a new repository in your account with the contents of this template.

Once you have created a new repository from this template, you can clone it to your local machine and start developing your COSMIC application.

## Development

When you open the repository in your code editor, you will see a lot of comments in the code. These comments are there to help you get a basic understanding of what each part of the code does.

Once you feel comfortable with it, refer back to the [COSMIC documentation](https://pop-os.github.io/libcosmic/cosmic/) for more information on how to build COSMIC applications.
